# Augmented Reality With ARKit for iOS

This is a series of tutorials focused on Augmented Reality with ARKit. Alongside MLKit, this was the framework announcement that impressed me the most. I strongly believe that ARKit is going to be a game changer for the Augmented Reality ecosystem.

This initial tutorial will get you started with ARKit in iOS with examples and little to no theory. First, we will start with just some basic concepts. Then, we will learn how to load different types of model, from static object to animated figures, mainly using SceneKit. Also, I will show you how to import blender models into ARKit. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to load and place virtual objects in the real world.
